# Workplace Analytics partner solution overview

Workplace Analytics provides rich insights into your company’s communication and collaboration trends to identify behaviors that affect your bottom line. Workplace Analytics uses Office 365 email and calendar metadata and turns it into a set of behavioral metrics that help you understand how your teams are currently spending their time and working together.

Workplace Analytics requires Office 365 Exchange Online mailbox data. If your organization uses on-premises Exchange mailboxes, you will need to do one of the following to use Workplace Analytics:

* Migrate your organization's mailboxes to [Exchange Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/exchange-online).
* Use a partner solution that replicates your organization's on-premises Exchange mailbox data into Office 365 storage mailbox data in Exchange Online. Workplace Analytics can then access and use the replicated mailbox data for all your organizational data analysis needs.

Your organization must comply with the system requirements and complete the setup tasks described in [Workplace Analytics partner solution setup](./partner-setup.md).
